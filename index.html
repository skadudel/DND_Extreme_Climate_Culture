            <div class="text">The Frosty Enclave is ruled by the flying elites. Their main town for non flying creatures is the trading town at the foot of the mountain, specifically set up so that it is the city closest to where people from other nations would come from making it a natural first stop for many visitors. The nobles impose heavy taxes on close to all businesses that do not recide on top of the mountain in the ruling city of () that mostly has been made with the ability of flight in mind, making it difficult for most flightless people to get around. Not only do the regular people of the Frosty Enclave suffer heavy taxes, there are also rules that oppress people without flight or that help to strengthen the ruling elite. Most of these rules have been ruled inneffective against anyone who does not live in the Frosty Enclave.</div>

            <div class="text">Desma is mostly a barren wasteland with nothing but heat and sand. But amongst the dunes there are plentiful of mountains along with a town and a rift in the very earth itself that has jagged black minerals along its side and lava at the very bottom. Desma has managed to become known for its excellent mineral quality and their exceptional blacksmith and warriors. Due to people usually not needing many warriors, the warriors of Desma usually become expert hunters that come back some of the best handled meat and hide or fur from the creatures they hunt. This leads to many warriors migrating to other regions in an attempt to find a job outside, so that they can make more income due to there being a lower percentage of people who are hunters and a chance to prove themselves by hunting creatures that you can't find in Desma making those prey far more interesting to hunt.</div>
